# 1. Write an algorithm in Python to generate random passwords.

## Hint :
First import the random module to generate random characters. Then, define a function 'generate_password' that takes a length as an argument and returns a random password of that length.

To generate the password, create a string of all the possible characters that can be used in the password. Then iterate over the length of the password and use random choice to select a random character from the string of possible characters, and append it to the password.
