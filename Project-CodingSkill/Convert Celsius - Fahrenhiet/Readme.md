# 2. Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Hint : 
This program will define a function called 'convert_temperature' that asks the user for a temperature and its unit of measurement (either Celsius or Fahrenheit). The function then converts the temperature to the other unit and prints out the result.If the user enters an invalid unit of measurement, the function prints an error message and calls itself again recursively to start over.
