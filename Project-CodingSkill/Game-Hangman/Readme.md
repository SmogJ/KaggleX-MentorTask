# 3. Create a simple text-based game called “Hangman”.

## Hint : 
Hangman is a word guessing game. The player must guess a word by suggesting letters that they think might be in the word. If a letter is correct, it is revealed in the word. If a letter is incorrect, a part of a stick figure is drawn on the screen. If the player can guess the word before the stick figure is completely drawn, they win. Otherwise, they lose.

The code will randomly select a word from a list, set up a game board with underscores representing each letter in the word, and then start a loop where the player is asked to guess a letter. If the letter is correct, it is revealed in the game board. If the letter is incorrect, a part of a stick figure is drawn. The loop continues until the player has guessed the word or the stick figure is complete, indicating a loss.
